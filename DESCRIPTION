Description: The simulate R package lets users simulate quantities of interest from statistical models, accounting for estimation and fundamental uncertainty. It serves as a simple homage to the Zelig package (and its cousin CLARIFY for Stata), which recently went offline for a bit on CRAN. The main goal is to provide a very barebones structure for tidy simulation that anyone can use for basic models (and can quickly adapt for new models).
